# PM-AutoSort
Python script I wrote to help me organize my tenant documents. I save all docs starting with a numerical apartment number and then description of the file. This tool reads the document name, if it has an apartment number that matches the directory tree I fed it, it will automatically move the file into the directory associated with that number.
